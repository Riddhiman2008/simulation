  'Event horizon' is the boundary defining the region of space around a black hole from which nothing (not even light, the fastest moving object of the universe) can escape. In other words, the escape velocity of an object within the event horizon exceeds the speed of light. Gray area in the in the simulation shown marks the event horizon and black mass shows the black hole that bends the light which is shown as red curves.
